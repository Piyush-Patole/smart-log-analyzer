🧠 Disclaimer
This project was created based on my original idea and developed with the assistance of AI tools, including ChatGPT by OpenAI. I used AI primarily to help with code generation, bug fixing, and writing documentation. All architectural decisions, problem statements, and final integrations were made by me, demonstrating my ability to leverage advanced tools effectively in real-world software development.



## 🔍 Smart Log Analyzer with AI Suggestions

An intelligent log file analysis tool that parses unstructured logs, classifies errors using NLP, and generates fix suggestions—automating part of the debugging process. Designed for DevOps, SREs, and developers to save time on log analysis and issue resolution.

## 🔍 How to Use

### 📁 Prepare Logs

Place your `.log` files in the `logs/` folder. Example file: `logs/plain.log`

### ▶️ Run the Analyzer

```bash
python -m src.main logs/plain.log default
```

### 📤 Output

| File                  | Location   | Description                          |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `enriched_output.csv` | `reports/` | Logs with categories and suggestions |
| `error_summary.json`  | `reports/` | Counts of each error type            |
| `error_summary.png`   | `reports/` | Bar chart of error distribution      |

## 🔬 Under the Hood

### 1. `reader.py`

Reads a plain log file and loads lines into a Pandas DataFrame.

### 2. `parser.py`

Uses regex to extract timestamps, error levels, and messages.

### 3. `classifier.py`

Uses spaCy’s NLP model to classify log lines into categories like:

* Database Error
* Timeout
* Not Found
* Unknown

### 4. `suggester.py`

Maps each category to predefined suggestions. Can be extended with GPT API or retrieval-augmented generation.

### 5. `reporter.py`

Generates:

* A CSV with full details
* JSON summary
* PNG chart using Seaborn

---

## 🌱 Future Enhancements

* [ ] Support JSON, syslog & Apache formats
* [ ] Integrate GPT for smarter suggestions
* [ ] Real-time log stream analysis
* [ ] GUI or web dashboard (Streamlit/FastAPI)
